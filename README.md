# The Lyrics Project
A Web-based music player, with Spotify-like lyrics display, synced to the song.
Includes a tool for importing custom songs with lyrics and timing them accordingly.

Made with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap CSS. Currently working on a **Vue.js** rewrite.
The repo went public after I've removed copyrighted material in the (now missing) **songs** directory. Working on adding a non-copyright example in there, so hang on!
